# Learn Envoy

## Overview

This repository contains the versions of [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) source files that I'm interested in and the notes I made for learning purpose. Therefore, the code in this repository belongs to the original authors of Envoy and should be used under the same license. See their [license](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/main/LICENSE).

Each version is in its own sub-folder. My notes are all marked with `NOTE(ywen)`. The log messages I added are prefixed with `[ywen]`.
